# Maistro Products

The four products represent the complete customer journey:

- establish presence (Websites)
- expand reach (Socials)
- acquire customers (Funnels)
- maintain relationships (Customers)

## Maistro Websites
The foundation for our customers' online presence, allowing them to create and manage professional websites. It's essential as it provides the destination for all other marketing activities.

## Maistro Socials
Provides social media integration, attribution tracking, and campaign management across platforms. It works as a standalone product but integrates with both Funnels (for acquisition) and Customers (for retention).

## Maistro Funnels
Handles the full acquisition process, including lead capture forms, conversion paths, and sales processes. By consolidating lead generation and conversion into one product, we've eliminated redundancy while creating a powerful tool for customer acquisition.

## Maistro Customers
Focuses on the post-conversion relationship, helping businesses track and optimize the customer lifecycle over 2-5 years. This long-term focus differentiates our platform from competitors that often focus only on acquisition.
